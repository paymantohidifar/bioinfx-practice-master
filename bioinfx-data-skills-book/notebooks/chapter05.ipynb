    "#### The Naming Convention Shift\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, `master` was the default branch name created by Git. However, in 2020, major platforms like GitHub changed their default branch name for new repositories to `main`. This change was made to promote more inclusive language by moving away from the term \"master,\" which has associations with slavery. Many other Git hosting services and organizations have since followed suit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to avoid issues when we push a local repo to a remote repo on Github, we need to change our head branch (`master`) to `main` using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git branch -M main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-M`: This is a shortcut for `--move --force`. It tells Git to rename the branch.\n",
    "    - `--move` (`-m`): Renames the branch.\n",
    "    - `--force` (`-f`): Forces the rename, even if a branch with the new name already exists. Using `-M` is a \"force\" move, which is why it's the standard for this action, as it prevents errors if you accidentally run it twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `main`: This is the new name you are giving to your branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the process of renaming the default branch, you would typically follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Push the new `main` branch to the remote: `git push -u origin main`\n",
    "2. Delete the old master branch from the remote: `git push origin --delete master`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-u` flag, short for `--set-upstream`, is used with the git push command to establish a connection between a local branch and a remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `git push -u origin main`, you are telling Git two things:\n",
    "1. **Push the local branch:** Push the commits from your current local branch to the remote branch named main on the origin remote.\n",
    "2. **Set the upstream branch:** Set `origin/main` as the upstream (or tracking) branch for your local main branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an Upstream Branch?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An upstream branch is the default remote branch that your local branch \"tracks.\" This relationship allows Git to simplify future commands. Once an upstream branch is set, you can simply run:\n",

    "- `git push`: This will automatically push your changes to the `origin/main` branch.\n",

    "This saves you from having to type the full command, such as `git pull origin main` or `git push origin main`, every time.\n",

    "Merge conflicts occur when Git can’t automatically merge your repository with the commits from the latest pull — Git needs your input on how best to resolve a conflict in the version of the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git offers three strategies to resolve merge conflicts (a.k.a. divergent branches). We can set a default strategy by updating git local or global config file or we can choose a strategy (on the fly) every time we have merge conflicts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Update config file**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config pull.rebase false # also called merge method (the default strategy)\n",
    "git config pul.rebase true   # rebase method\n",
    "git config pull.ff only      # fast-forward only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **on the fly**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull --no-rebase origin master # merge\n",
    "git pull --rebase origin master    # rebase\n",
    "git pull --ff-only origin master   ## fast-forward only\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some details about the three strategies Git recommends:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git pull --rebase`: This option uses the **rebase** strategy. It takes your local commits, temporarily sets them aside, and updates your branch to match the remote's latest state. Then, it reapplies your commits on top of the remote's history. This creates a linear, clean history with no merge commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git pull --no-rebase` or `git pull`: This option uses the **merge** strategy, which is the default. It creates a new merge commit that combines the histories of your local and the remote branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git pull --ff-only`: This option uses the **fast-forward** only strategy. It will only update your local branch if it can do so without creating a new merge commit. If your branches have diverged, this command will fail, as a fast-forward is not possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we pulled the latest commit, we need to do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use `git status` to find the conflicting file(s).\n",
    "2. Open and edit those files manually to a version that fixes the conflict.\n",
    "3. Use `git add` to tell Git that you’ve resolved the conflict in a particular file.\n",
    "4. Once all conflicts are resolved, use `git status` to check that all changes are\n",
    "staged. Then, commit the resolved versions of the conflicting file(s). It’s also wise\n",
    "to immediately push this merge commit, so your collaborators see that you’ve\n",
    "resolved a conflict and can continue their work on this new version accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex merge conflicts, you may want to use a merge tool. Merge tools help visualize merge conflicts by placing both versions side by side, and pointing out what’s different (rather than using Git’s inline notation that uses inequality and equal signs). Some commonly used merge tools include `Meld` and `Kdiff`. Some IDEs may also have this capability.\n"

    "#### Difference between `fetch` and `pull`\n",
    "\n",
    "The core difference between `git fetch` and `git pull` is how they handle integrating changes from a remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`git fetch`** downloads new data from a remote repository into your local repository, but it **does not** integrate those changes into your current working branch. This command is considered \"safe\" because it won't alter your local code or cause any merge conflicts. It updates your local copy of the remote's branches (e.g., `origin/main`), allowing you to review changes before deciding what to do with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**`git pull`** is a two-step command that automatically performs a **`git fetch`** and then a **`git merge`**. It fetches the new data and immediately attempts to merge it into your current working branch. This can be convenient for quickly updating your branch, but it can also lead to merge conflicts if you have uncommitted local changes that conflict with the incoming remote changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | `git fetch` | `git pull` |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Action** | Downloads remote changes. | Downloads remote changes and merges them into your current branch. |\n",
    "| **Safety** | **Safe.** Does not alter your local working files. | **Potentially Unsafe.** May cause merge conflicts or overwrite local changes. |\n",
    "| **Process** | A single step. | A two-step process: `git fetch` followed by `git merge`. |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Use when you want to see what's new on the remote without disrupting your current work. | Use when you're ready to sync your local branch with the remote and are confident there won't be conflicts. |\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended workflow for more control is to use `git fetch` to get the latest updates, then use commands like `git status` or `git diff` (`git diff main origin/main`) to review the changes. When you're ready, you can then `git merge` or `git rebase` the remote branch into your local one."

    "- **Cloning**: You then clone your own forked version to your local machine to begin development.\n",
    "- **Non-interference**: Your changes and pushes to your forked repository will not affect the original main project.\n",
    "- **Pull Request**: If you want to share your changes with the main project, you submit a pull request on GitHub to have your commits pulled into the main repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is ideal for projects with many contributors because it allows lead developers to control which commits are added to the main project. This prevents new changes from accidentally breaking functionality or creating bugs. In contrast, a shared central repository allows all collaborators to push their commits to the main project directly.\n"

    "### Git Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Git tags to mark significant points in your repository's history, typically for releases. They serve as permanent, easy-to-read references to specific commits, like a bookmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases for Git Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Releasing Software Versions:** This is the most common use of tags. When you release a new version of your software (e.g., v1.0, v2.5.3), you create a tag on the commit that corresponds to that release. This allows you or others to easily check out that exact version of the codebase later.\n",
    "2.  **Marking Production Builds:** Tags can be used to mark a specific commit that was deployed to a production environment. This is useful for debugging issues, as you can quickly see the exact state of the code that's currently live.\n",
    "3.  **Archiving Major Milestones:** You can use tags to mark important milestones or major checkpoints in a project's history, such as a proof-of-concept completion or a significant feature implementation.\n",
    "4.  **Creating Release Branches:** Some workflows use a tagging system to create release branches. A tag on `main` might signify the starting point for a new release branch, where further bug fixes are applied before the final version is tagged and shipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to Use Git Tags\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Lightweight Tags**: These are simple pointers to a commit and are generally used for local, temporary marks.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git tag v1.0.0\n",
    "    git tag v1.0.0 <commit_hash>  # to tag a specific commit\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * **Annotated Tags**: These are recommended for releases because they contain more information, such as the tagger's name, email, and a message.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m \"Initial public release\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * **Pushing Tags to the Remote**: Unlike branches, tags are not automatically pushed to the remote repository. You must push them explicitly.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin --tags\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This command pushes all tags to the remote repository. You can also push a single tag.\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git push origin v1.0.0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, think of **tags as read-only, permanent labels** on your repository's history. They are distinct from branches, which are designed to move and evolve."

    "### Good Commit Message Practice\n",
    "You don't need to mention the names of the files you modified in a Git commit message. It is generally considered a bad practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Not to Include File Names\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Redundancy:** Git automatically tracks which files are changed in a commit. You can always see the list of modified files by using commands like `git show` or `git log --stat`. Listing them in the commit message is redundant.\n",
    "2.  **Focus on \"Why\":** A good commit message should explain **why** the changes were made, not just **what** was changed. The \"why\" is crucial for understanding the project's history. Explaining the purpose of the change (e.g., \"Fix bug with user login\" or \"Implement user profile page\") is far more helpful to future collaborators and your future self.\n",
    "3.  **Encourages Bad Commits:** Including file names can lead to large, unfocused commits where many unrelated changes are lumped together. Good practice is to make small, atomic commits that each address a single, logical change.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Makes a Good Commit Message?\n",
    "\n",
    "A good commit message follows a widely accepted format: a short summary line followed by a more detailed body.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **First Line (Subject):** A concise, imperative summary of the change, ideally 50 characters or less.\n",
    "      * **Good:** `Fix: Add validation to user email input`\n",
    "      * **Bad:** `Fixing a bug in user.js and profile.js because the email wasn't validating right.`\n",
    "2.  **Body (Optional):** A blank line followed by a more detailed explanation of the change. This is where you can describe the problem you're solving, the approach you took, and any trade-offs you considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a well-written commit message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "feat: Add user profile page\n",
    "\n",
    "This commit introduces a new user profile page.\n",
    "The page displays the user's name, email, and a list of their recent activity.\n",
    "It also includes an \"edit\" button to allow users to update their information.\n",
    "The design follows the new style guidelines for user-facing pages.\n",

    "### Working with Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Git’s branches are virtual, meaning that branching doesn’t require actually copying files in your repository. Here are some examples of how branches can help you in your bioinformatics work:\n",
    "- Branches allow you to experiment in your project without the risk of adversely affecting the main branch, master.\n",
    "- If you’re developing software, branches allow you to develop new features or bug fixes without affecting the working production version, the master branch. Once the feature or bug fix is complete, you can merge it into the master branch, incorporating the change into your production version.\n",
    "- branches simplify working collaboratively on repositories. Each collaborator can work on their own separate branches, which prevents disrupting the master branch for other collaborators. When a collaborator’s changes are ready to be shared, they can be merged into the master branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and Working with Branches: `git branch` and `git checkout`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the list of a few branching subcommands:\n",
    "- `git branch <branch_name>`: creates a Git branch called `<branch_name>`\n",
    "- `git branch`: lists all branches\n",
    "- `git checkout <branch_name>`: switches to the `<branch_name>` branch\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging Branches: `git merge`\n",
    "\n",
    "To merge branches, first, use `git checkout` to switch to the branch we want to merge the other branch into. Then, use `git merge <otherbranch>` to merge the other branch into the current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that merge conflicts can occur when merging branches. In fact, merge conflicts happen when pulling in remote changes - `git pull` does a merge between a remote branch and a local branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branches and Remotes\n",
    "The branch we created in the previous section was entirely local—so far, our collaborators are unable to see this branch or its commits. This is a nice feature of Git: you can create and work with branches to fit your workflow needs without having to share these branches with collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote branches are a special type of local branch. Using `git branch --all`, we can see these hidden remote branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a new branch that starts with a branch in remote:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b new-branch origin/new-branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Git notified us that it’s tracking this branch. This means that this local branch knows which remote branch to push to and pull from if we were to just use `git push` or `git pull` without arguments.\n"

    "A good branch naming convention helps keep your repository organized and makes it easier for collaborators to understand the purpose of each branch. The key is to be descriptive, consistent, and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Be Descriptive:** The branch name should immediately tell you what work is being done. Avoid vague names like `fix` or `update`.\n",
    "* **Use Hyphens:** Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words. Avoid spaces, underscores (`_`), or other special characters, as they can cause issues in the command line.\n",
    "* **Be Consistent:** Stick to a single naming convention across your entire team. This prevents confusion and streamlines the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several popular conventions you can adopt. The most common involves a prefix that indicates the type of work being done.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature Branches (`feat/` or `feature/`)**: For new features or significant changes.\n",
    "    * `feat/user-login`\n",
    "    * `feature/shopping-cart`\n",
    "    * `feat/add-api-endpoint`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Bug Fix Branches (`fix/` or `bugfix/`)**: For bug fixes. You can also include the issue tracker number.\n",
    "    * `fix/broken-auth-flow`\n",
    "    * `bugfix/checkout-button`\n",
    "    * `fix/123-api-error`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/`)**: For urgent, production-level bug fixes.\n",
    "    * `hotfix/critical-api-bug`\n",
    "    * `hotfix/login-crash`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Documentation Branches (`docs/`)**: For changes to documentation.\n",
    "    * `docs/api-readme-update`\n",
    "    * `docs/user-guide`\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Chore Branches (`chore/`)**: For routine maintenance tasks that don't change the application's code.\n",
    "    * `chore/update-dependencies`\n",
    "    * `chore/add-gitignore-file`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start a new feature:** `git checkout -b feat/add-user-profile`\n",
    "2.  **Fix a bug:** `git checkout -b fix/password-validation`\n",
    "3.  **Work on an urgent fix:** `git checkout -b hotfix/server-crash`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a consistent prefix makes it easy to filter branches, review pull requests, and understand the project's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the forward slash (`/`) in a Git branch name doesn't create sub-branches in a technical sense. It's a naming convention that provides a logical grouping of branches, but Git treats it as a single string."

    "### How to Use Issue Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, here is a practical example of how to use issue numbers in a Git commit message as part of a typical development workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume you are using **GitHub** to manage a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Scenario 💻\n",
    "\n",
    "A user reports a bug: The login button on the website doesn't work on mobile devices. You create a new issue in your repository to track this problem. GitHub automatically assigns it an issue number, for example, **\\#42**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a New Branch:** To fix the bug, you create a new local branch. A good practice is to name the branch to reflect its purpose and the issue number.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git checkout -b fix/42-mobile-login\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Make the Code Changes:** You open the relevant code files, fix the issue with the mobile login button, and save your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Commit the Changes:** Now, you need to commit your changes. This is where you include the issue number in the commit message to link the code to the issue. The phrase \"**Fixes \\#42**\" tells GitHub that this commit is intended to resolve issue \\#42.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    git add .\n",
    "    git commit -m \"Fixes #42 - Correct alignment of login button on mobile\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "      * `Fixes #42`: This specific syntax tells GitHub to automatically **close** issue \\#42 when this commit is merged into the `main` branch. Other keywords like `Closes` or `Resolves` also work.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Push and Merge:** You push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request. When the pull request is approved and merged into `main`, GitHub sees the `Fixes #42` keyword in the commit message. It then automatically closes the issue and leaves a comment on the issue itself, showing which commit and pull request resolved it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Benefit 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple practice creates a traceable history. Anyone looking at issue **\\#42** can see exactly which code was changed to fix the bug. Similarly, someone reviewing the commit history can click the issue link to understand the full context behind the change, including the original bug report and any related discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Create Issues\n",
    "The issue number is not something you choose; it's a unique number **assigned automatically** by your project's issue tracking system, such as GitHub Issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "To name your branch with the correct issue number, you need to first create an issue for the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a step-by-step guide on how to get the issue number for your branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1\\. Create the Issue on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "When you discover a bug, go to the **\"Issues\"** tab in your GitHub repository and click the **\"New issue\"** button. Fill out the bug report with a clear title and description. When you click **\"Submit new issue,\"** GitHub automatically assigns a unique number to it. For example, GitHub might label it as **\\#42**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2\\. Get the Issue Number\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the issue, note the number assigned to it (e.g., `#42`). This is the number you will use to name your branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3\\. Create Your Branch with the Issue Number\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the issue number, go to your local repository in the terminal and create a new branch. It's a best practice to use a prefix like `fix/` for bug fixes and include the issue number in the branch name.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b fix/42-bug-description\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this process, your local branch name is directly tied to the issue you are working on, making it clear to you and your team what the branch is for. When you later submit a pull request, you can link the branch to the issue, making your entire workflow more organized and traceable."
